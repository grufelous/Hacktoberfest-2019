<h1>Range Minimum Query1</h1>
<p>You are given a list of N numbers and Q queries. <br>Each query is specified by two numbers i and j;<br> the answer to each query is the minimum number between the range [i, j] (inclusive).<br>


Note: the query ranges are specified using 0-based indexing.</p>

<h2>Input 2</h2>
The first line contains N, the number of integers in our list (N <= 100,000). The next line holds N numbers that are guaranteed to fit inside an integer. Following the list is a number Q (Q <= 10,000). The next Q lines each contain two numbers i and j which specify a query you must answer (0 <= i, j <= N-1).

<h3>Output 2</h3>
For each query, output the answer to that query on its own line in the order the queries were made.
